    <h2> methamphetamine </h2>
    <p>The document provides instructions for producing 
      methamphetamine through a "shake and bake" method. It lists 
      materials needed such as bottles, tubing, pliers, measuring 
      cups, and chemical ingredients including ammonium nitrate, 
      lye, Coleman fuel, lithium strips, and pseudoephedrine pills. 
      It provides step-by-step directions for mixing the chemicals, 
      adding water to start the reaction, venting pressure from the 
      bottle, and filtering out the final methamphetamine product. A 
      gassing process is described to further extract the meth using 
      hydrochloric acid gas.</p>
