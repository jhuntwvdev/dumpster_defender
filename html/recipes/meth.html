    <h1> Methamphetamine </h1>
    <p> The document provides instructions for producing methamphetamine through a "shake and bake" method. It lists materials needed such as bottles, tubing, pliers, measuring cups, and chemical ingredients including ammonium nitrate, lye, Coleman fuel, lithium strips, and pseudoephedrine pills. It provides step-by-step directions for mixing the chemicals, adding water to start the reaction, venting pressure from the bottle, and filtering out the final methamphetamine product. A gassing process is described to further extract the meth using hydrochloric acid gas.
